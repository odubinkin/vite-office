    Complete current Writer model slice across TXT RTF Markdown filters

    Audit represented Writer body, paragraph, character, list, table, and hyperlink contracts against pinned LibreOffice sources; close format import/export gaps in the already approved native filter scope and verify targeted behavior.
  Scope: "In scope: current Writer document model body blocks, text runs, hyperlinks, paragraph attributes, lists and tables across native TXT export, RTF and Markdown import/export; filter-to-shell-to-browser connection; pinned upstream comparison; targeted tests and provenance. Out of scope: model features absent from the current core, recovery and browser save/autosave deviations, unrelated formats and full regression suite before task ten."
  Plan: "Audit canonical Writer body and attribute model against pinned LibreOffice TXT RTF Markdown paths; repair all represented import and export gaps in current filter scope; add a capability matrix and targeted round-trip tests; run TypeScript, lint, provenance, registry and module-boundary checks. Keep browser save deviations intact; no full suite before tenth task."
  Verify Steps: "1. Run focused Writer TXT, RTF, Markdown filter and document I/O tests; all pass. 2. Run TypeScript typecheck and ESLint/Prettier for changed source; all pass. 3. Run source-provenance, Writer registry and module-boundary checks; all pass. 4. Review the capability matrix against current SwDoc/SwTextNode/SwTable and pinned upstream sources, recording supported, format-inapplicable and unsupported cases with evidence. 5. Confirm git status has no unintended changes."

## Summary

Complete current Writer model slice across TXT RTF Markdown filters

Audit represented Writer body, paragraph, character, list, table, and hyperlink contracts against pinned LibreOffice sources; close format import/export gaps in the already approved native filter scope and verify targeted behavior.

## Scope

In scope: current Writer document model body blocks, text runs, hyperlinks, paragraph attributes, lists and tables across native TXT export, RTF and Markdown import/export; filter-to-shell-to-browser connection; pinned upstream comparison; targeted tests and provenance. Out of scope: model features absent from the current core, recovery and browser save/autosave deviations, unrelated formats and full regression suite before task ten.

## Plan

Audit canonical Writer body and attribute model against pinned LibreOffice TXT RTF Markdown paths; repair all represented import and export gaps in current filter scope; add a capability matrix and targeted round-trip tests; run TypeScript, lint, provenance, registry and module-boundary checks. Keep browser save deviations intact; no full suite before tenth task.

## Verify Steps

1. Run focused Writer TXT, RTF, Markdown filter and document I/O tests; all pass. 2. Run TypeScript typecheck and ESLint/Prettier for changed source; all pass. 3. Run source-provenance, Writer registry and module-boundary checks; all pass. 4. Review the capability matrix against current SwDoc/SwTextNode/SwTable and pinned upstream sources, recording supported, format-inapplicable and unsupported cases with evidence. 5. Confirm git status has no unintended changes.

## Rollback Plan

- Revert task-related commit(s).
- Re-run required checks to confirm rollback safety.
