    Complete current Writer model slice across TXT RTF Markdown filters

    Audit represented Writer body, paragraph, character, list, table, and hyperlink contracts against pinned LibreOffice sources; close format import/export gaps in the already approved native filter scope and verify targeted behavior.
  Scope: "In scope: current Writer document model body blocks, text runs, hyperlinks, paragraph attributes, lists and tables across native TXT export, RTF and Markdown import/export; filter-to-shell-to-browser connection; pinned upstream comparison; targeted tests and provenance. Out of scope: model features absent from the current core, recovery and browser save/autosave deviations, unrelated formats and full regression suite before task ten."
  Plan: "Audit canonical Writer body and attribute model against pinned LibreOffice TXT RTF Markdown paths; repair all represented import and export gaps in current filter scope; add a capability matrix and targeted round-trip tests; run TypeScript, lint, provenance, registry and module-boundary checks. Keep browser save deviations intact; no full suite before tenth task."
  Verify Steps: "1. Run focused Writer TXT, RTF, Markdown filter and document I/O tests; all pass. 2. Run TypeScript typecheck and ESLint/Prettier for changed source; all pass. 3. Run source-provenance, Writer registry and module-boundary checks; all pass. 4. Review the capability matrix against current SwDoc/SwTextNode/SwTable and pinned upstream sources, recording supported, format-inapplicable and unsupported cases with evidence. 5. Confirm git status has no unintended changes."

## Summary

Complete current Writer model slice across TXT RTF Markdown filters

Audit represented Writer body, paragraph, character, list, table, and hyperlink contracts against pinned LibreOffice sources; close format import/export gaps in the already approved native filter scope and verify targeted behavior.

## Scope

In scope: current Writer document model body blocks, text runs, hyperlinks, paragraph attributes, lists and tables across native TXT export, RTF and Markdown import/export; filter-to-shell-to-browser connection; pinned upstream comparison; targeted tests and provenance. Out of scope: model features absent from the current core, recovery and browser save/autosave deviations, unrelated formats and full regression suite before task ten.

## Plan

Audit canonical Writer body and attribute model against pinned LibreOffice TXT RTF Markdown paths; repair all represented import and export gaps in current filter scope; add a capability matrix and targeted round-trip tests; run TypeScript, lint, provenance, registry and module-boundary checks. Keep browser save deviations intact; no full suite before tenth task.

## Verify Steps

1. Run focused Writer TXT, RTF, Markdown filter and document I/O tests; all pass. 2. Run TypeScript typecheck and ESLint/Prettier for changed source; all pass. 3. Run source-provenance, Writer registry and module-boundary checks; all pass. 4. Review the capability matrix against current SwDoc/SwTextNode/SwTable and pinned upstream sources, recording supported, format-inapplicable and unsupported cases with evidence. 5. Confirm git status has no unintended changes.

## Verification

<!-- END VERIFICATION RESULTS -->

## Rollback Plan

- Revert task-related commit(s).
- Re-run required checks to confirm rollback safety.

## Findings

Interim audit, not closure. The capability matrix is docs/program/writer-native-text-filter-slice.md; earlier commits through b9b1fa5d94be cover native TXT, RTF, and Markdown paths and upstream asymmetries WRITER096-106. This batch aligns RTF table row controls with pinned RtfAttributeOutput::TableDefinition: orientation, default left-to-right TableBidi, height, then row split. The current table frame has no direction item, so right-to-left table direction is outside its represented model. Focused RTF reader/exporter tests (77) and TXT/Markdown tests (39), office TypeScript, changed-path ESLint/Prettier, source provenance, Writer registry, module-boundary and diff checks pass. Remaining current-model gaps include complete md4c syntax/callback parity, URL normalization, RTF field/style/list/table/paragraph and section-chain differentials, physical font metrics and compiled upstream comparisons. Pinned md4c source is absent locally and network approval has not been granted. Full current-slice parity is not confirmed; no final verification yet.
