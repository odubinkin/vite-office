# Observed Writer upstream cases requiring review

These observations come from the pinned LibreOffice baseline
`9bc445578031fecf56086729d8e4940c77e14d65` (`libreoffice-26.8.0.2`). They document
suspicious source conditions and their consequences. They are not confirmed
upstream defect reports: complete consumer invariants, history and intended
behavior have not been established.

The user explicitly requires reproducing upstream behavior. Recording a case
here does not authorize fixing it, normalizing it or changing defaults. Writer
retains the original defined behavior. Undefined native arithmetic or invalid
lifetimes are outside parity certification; no invented successful result is
assigned to them.

Each entry records original source, an initialized example or proof, evidence,
remaining uncertainty and the current implementation decision, following
[the shared observation format](upstream-suspected-issues.md). No upstream issue
was filed or external publication performed.

## WRITER-001: Hanging first-line setters replace relative left units with empty-context twips

Status: suspicious unit/context loss; original source expressions verified and
portable initialized examples reproduced. Complete native consumer invariants
and a compiled native differential result remain unverified.

Original [`SvxLRSpaceItem::SetTextFirstLineOffset`](https://github.com/LibreOffice/core/blob/9bc445578031fecf56086729d8e4940c77e14d65/editeng/source/items/frmitems.cxx#L738)
removes an old negative offset and adds a new negative offset by resolving both
measures with an empty `SvxFontUnitMetrics` context and assigning a fresh
`SvxIndentValue::twips` to the stored left margin. Original
[`SetTextLeft`](https://github.com/LibreOffice/core/blob/9bc445578031fecf56086729d8e4940c77e14d65/editeng/source/items/frmitems.cxx#L775)
performs the same empty-context addition when the first-line offset is negative.
[`GetTextLeft`](https://github.com/LibreOffice/core/blob/9bc445578031fecf56086729d8e4940c77e14d65/editeng/source/items/frmitems.cxx#L862)
returns a newly resolved twip measure in that hanging-offset case. A font-relative
left value can therefore lose both its original unit and its font-dependent
contribution before a later layout receives initialized font metrics.

Initialized example: set text-left to `2 FONT_EM`, then first-line to
`-1 FONT_CJK_ADVANCE`. Empty metrics resolve both font contributions to zero;
the stored left margin and returned text-left value become `0 TWIP`.
With subsequently supplied metrics `em=100`, `ic=200`, first-line resolves to
`-200` and `ResolveTextLeft` returns `200` through its original subtraction,
while `GetTextLeft` still returns the empty-context `0 TWIP`. The original
first-line measure retains its `-1 FONT_CJK_ADVANCE` unit/value.

A second initialized example starts with left `200 TWIP`, right `70 TWIP` and
first-line `-30 TWIP`; stored left is `170 TWIP`. Applying the published
text-left unit member15 with `2.5 FONT_EM` changes stored left to `-30 TWIP`
and subsequent text-left resolution to zero, even with `em=120`. Applying the
right unit member14 instead retains the stored left `170 TWIP` and resolves
right to `300` with those metrics. This distinction is separate from the
locally corrected swapped member IDs; the ID swap was a port defect, not an
upstream suspected issue.

Evidence: exact pinned `frmitems.cxx` definitions and original metrics/unit
contracts in `include/editeng/lrspitem.hxx`; existing
[`native-lr-font-units.test.ts`](../../apps/office/src/editeng/source/items/native-lr-font-units.test.ts)
case `negative relative first line retains native empty-context conversion
while explicit metrics resolve it`, plus the independent initialized
hanging-side examples in
[`native-lr-member-routing.test.ts`](../../apps/office/src/sw/source/core/table/native-lr-member-routing.test.ts).
Task `202610101340-HB1SPN` records source hashes and upstream-absent acceptance.
These tests execute the portable implementation, not pinned upstream code.

Complete native callers may constrain LR items to absolute units when using
hanging indentation; the separate paragraph text-left/first-line item classes
also provide other layout contracts. Those invariants and historical intent
remain unreviewed. Decision: preserve the empty-context resolution, setter
order, twip reassignment and getter distinction. Do not retain a relative unit,
substitute later font metrics or normalize the original behavior.

## WRITER-002: Right-margin percentage writes change metadata without rescaling the measure

Status: suspicious setter asymmetry; pinned source expressions inspected and
portable initialized acceptance authored. Complete native consumer invariants
and a compiled native differential remain unverified.

Original [SvxRightMarginItem::PutValue](https://github.com/LibreOffice/core/blob/9bc445578031fecf56086729d8e4940c77e14d65/editeng/source/items/frmitems.cxx#L1582)
handles right-relative member7 by assigning only the unsigned percentage field.
It admits integer values from0 through65534; the typed SetRight setter instead
accepts an unsigned16 percentage including65535 and scales the supplied double.
The getters and UNO status cast percentage metadata to signed16. Consequently,
percentage metadata, stored measure and reported signed percentage can differ
from what a caller infers from the setter name alone.

Initialized example: create right-margin -72 TWIP, then PutValue(32768,7).
The stored margin remains -72 TWIP and ResolveRight remains -72. GetPropRight
returns32768, while QueryValue(7) and the full status ScaleRight return -32768.
Calling SetRight with1.25 FONT_EM and percentage65535 instead stores819.1875
FONT_EM. PutValue(65535,7) rejects without changing that item. Clone and native
paragraph Undo/Redo retain the stored double, unit and percentage independently.

Evidence: pinned frmitems.cxx SetRight and PutValue definitions, the unsigned16
field in include/editeng/lrspitem.hxx and initialized portable checks in
[native-right-margin-item.test.ts](../../apps/office/src/editeng/source/items/native-right-margin-item.test.ts)
and [native-paragraph-right-margin.test.ts](../../apps/office/src/sw/source/core/attr/native-paragraph-right-margin.test.ts).
Task202610101401-QJ0FFB records final source and acceptance evidence. Tests run
only the portable implementation with both ignored references absent.

Consumer order or historical API design may intentionally distinguish a
metadata-only UNO write from a value setter. These invariants remain unreviewed;
this is not a confirmed defect. Decision: preserve the setter asymmetry,
unsigned admission boundary and signed status cast. Do not rescale on member7,
clamp the percentage or reconstruct state through an inverse scaling adapter.

Additional original text-left observation:
[SvxTextLeftMarginItem::PutValue](https://github.com/LibreOffice/core/blob/9bc445578031fecf56086729d8e4940c77e14d65/editeng/source/items/frmitems.cxx#L1103)
uses the same metadata-only percentage contract on member6. A text-left item initialized with -72
TWIP keeps -72 after PutValue(32768,6), while GetPropLeft returns32768 and default status ScaleLeft
reports -32768. SetTextLeft accepts uint16 percentage65535 and scales the supplied double;
PutValue(65535,6) rejects. The initialized portable cases in
[native-text-left-margin-item.test.ts](../../apps/office/src/editeng/source/items/native-text-left-margin-item.test.ts)
and mutable paragraph-history cases in
[native-paragraph-text-left-margin.test.ts](../../apps/office/src/sw/source/core/attr/native-paragraph-text-left-margin.test.ts)
retain the distinction. Task202610101650-7RCNDA records this additional source observation. Consumer
order and native differential remain unverified; preserve the original stored measure, unsigned
admission and signed status metadata.

## WRITER-003: First-line default UNO query remains unsupported despite dispatcher comment

Status: suspicious default-query mismatch; pinned source switch and comment
inspected. Portable initialized cases are authored. Native dispatcher selection,
complete consumer invariants and a compiled native differential remain unverified.

Original [SvxFirstLineIndentItem::QueryValue](https://github.com/LibreOffice/core/blob/9bc445578031fecf56086729d8e4940c77e14d65/editeng/source/items/frmitems.cxx#L1323)
accepts only absolute indent member8, relative percentage9, automatic mode10
and double/unit pair13. Its default branch returns false and comments that
SfxDispatchController_Impl::StateChanged calls with hardcoded0. Unlike the
separate text-left and right classes, this switch has no member0 status case.
The declaration supplies a default member0 argument. A valid first-line item
can therefore expose its individual values while its default UNO query has
no supported result.

Initialized portable example: construct first-line -72 TWIP, enable automatic
mode and set percentage metadata32768. QueryValue(8) returns -72,
QueryValue(9) returns -32768 and QueryValue(10) returns true. QueryValue()
and QueryValue(0x80) remain unsupported; neither changes the original measure,
unit, percentage or automatic flag. The portable unsupported result is
undefined, representing native false admission rather than an invented
scalar, tuple or LeftRightMarginScale status.

Evidence: pinned frmitems.cxx switch, original default argument in
include/editeng/lrspitem.hxx and
[native-first-line-indent-item.test.ts](../../apps/office/src/editeng/source/items/native-first-line-indent-item.test.ts).
Task202610101510-P5FPXY records source and upstream-absent acceptance evidence;
tests execute only the portable implementation. Existing persistence records
are produced by the browser codec using native getters, not by changing the
native default query.

The dispatcher may avoid querying first-line items or provide an explicit
member elsewhere. Those invariants and historical intent remain unreviewed;
this is not a confirmed upstream defect. Decision: retain unsupported member0
and the original explicit native members. Do not add a status struct or keep
the old scalar/automatic tuple inside the core QueryValue contract.

## WRITER-004: Table attribute history resets only the first recorded WhichId

Baseline: LibreOffice26.8.0.2, commit
`9bc445578031fecf56086729d8e4940c77e14d65`. Source:
`sw/source/core/undo/rolbck.cxx`,
`SwHistorySetAttrSet::SetInDoc` around lines936..958.

The constructor partitions changed items into copied old values and a reset
array according to the originally present direct WhichIds. Content-node rollback
applies the old set and resets the whole array. Table-node rollback applies the
old frame set, then calls ResetFormatAttr with only the first array element.

A defined initialized table example has direct LR Which98 and UL Which99, with
both identities in the history reset partition. Rollback removes direct LR and
leaves direct UL in place. The portable acceptance preserves this literal result
in native-margin-history-boundaries.test.ts. Both items are real native pooled
format values; tests execute without either upstream reference.

This is an observation, not a confirmed upstream defect: whether original table
callers can produce more than one reset identity and whether surrounding
consumer contracts intentionally constrain the array remains unreviewed.
Decision: preserve the table first-only reset, retain the content-node complete
reset and do not normalize the two branches. Task202610101723-QH6XM1 records
source hashes and current portable acceptance evidence.

## WRITER-005: Margin admission reads legacy LR while mutation authors separate margin items

Baseline: LibreOffice26.8.0.2, commit
`9bc445578031fecf56086729d8e4940c77e14d65`. Source:
`sw/source/core/edit/edattr.cxx`, SwEditShell::IsMoveLeftMargin481..532;
`sw/source/core/doc/docfmt.cxx`, SwDoc::MoveLeftMargin1681..1755;
`sw/inc/node.hxx`, SwContentNode::GetAttr753..758;
`sw/source/core/bastyp/init.cxx`, original default LR item404.

Increase admission reads RES_LR_SPACE through the ordinary inherited attribute
getter. It resolves text-left, adds the unsigned16 default-tab distance and then
optionally snaps before comparing actual layout-frame width. Document mutation
instead copies and authors RES_MARGIN_FIRSTLINE and RES_MARGIN_TEXTLEFT, and
merges applicable list geometry. The getter directly returns GetSwAttrSet().Get;
it does not synthesize a legacy LR item from the separate paragraph margins.

A defined initialized item-profile example has inherited legacy LR text-left0
and independently authored typed text-left300. With default distance720,
admission compares720 plus5mm while unsnapped mutation authors1020. Independently
changing legacy LR changes the comparison without changing the authored typed
margin. Negative inputs also expose the source add-before-snap admission order,
which differs from the document snap-before-add mutation order.

This is not a confirmed upstream defect: original caller invariants, format
population and actual native paragraph-frame geometry remain unreviewed. The
portable frame-width accommodation cannot establish original frame admission.
Decision: preserve the literal WhichIds, independent item ownership and both
arithmetic orders; do not replace admission with a scalar prediction of mutation.
Task202610101813-PW1696 records source hashes and portable core/React/browser
acceptance. Tests execute without either upstream reference. Native frame lookup,
absence, vertical geometry and merged/redline paragraphs remain unverified.

The guard also narrows the default tab distance to unsigned 16 bits, while the
document operation retains its signed 32-bit value. A literal 65537 default
therefore becomes 1 for admission and remains 65537 for mutation; the port
keeps both contracts without normalizing them.

The native text-node and paragraph-style ranges in init.cxx155..188 include
RES_LR_SPACE through the complete frame-attribute range. The existing portable
ranges omitted this already registered item; taskPW1696 restores its membership
so the represented direct/inherited item-profile examples are admitted. Caller
population invariants and original layout-frame behavior remain unreviewed.

## WRITER-006: A zero-area rectangle contains its original point

Baseline: LibreOffice26.8.0.2, commit `9bc445578031fecf56086729d8e4940c77e14d65`.
Original [SwRect integer edges and emptiness](https://github.com/LibreOffice/core/blob/9bc445578031fecf56086729d8e4940c77e14d65/sw/inc/swrect.hxx#L67)
return the left/top origin for zero width/height and define HasArea as both
dimensions being nonzero. Original [Contains](https://github.com/LibreOffice/core/blob/9bc445578031fecf56086729d8e4940c77e14d65/sw/inc/swrect.hxx#L218)
compares inclusive integer edges without an area guard.

Initialized example: SwRect(7,11,0,0) has HasArea false and IsEmpty true,
but Right is7 and Bottom is11. Contains(Point(7,11)) and containment of another
zero-area rectangle at that origin both return true; Point(8,11) is outside.
Size::IsEmpty also differs from SwRect::IsEmpty for negative dimensions: Size
uses nonpositive dimensions, whereas SwRect tests zeros only.

Evidence: pinned swrect.hxx edge/Contains/HasArea definitions and literal
portable checks in [native-frame-area.test.ts](../../apps/office/src/sw/source/core/inc/native-frame-area.test.ts).
Task202610111735-R760SH checks these contracts on the portable implementation;
the tests never execute pinned upstream sources.

This is a suspicious empty-containment result, not a confirmed upstream defect.
Native consumer invariants and a compiled native differential remain unverified.
Decision: preserve zero-origin fallback, inclusive predicates and distinct size
and rectangle emptiness. Do not add an area guard or normalize negative sizes.

## WRITER-007: Absolute search normalizes typographic quotes differently by direction

Pinned `i18npool/source/search/textsearch.cxx`, `searchForward` and
`searchBackward`, tests `bSearchApostrophe && isReplacePunctuation(in_str)` in
both directions. Without a transliteration service, the forward branch replaces
only U+2019 with ASCII apostrophe. The backward branch calls
`replacePunctuation`, which maps all U+2018..U+201F quote forms. With a simple
transliteration service both directions call the complete helper.

Source-derived initialized example: searching ASCII apostrophe in the one-unit
string U+2018, with absolute algorithm and no transliteration, fails forward but
matches [1,0] backward. With IGNORE_CASE it matches in both directions. An ASCII
double quote similarly finds U+201C backward only without transliteration.
Portable tests in `i18npool/source/search/textsearch.test.ts` preserve all eight
quote forms; they do not execute the native implementation. Native consumer
invariants and a compiled differential remain unverified. Decision: retain the
original directional asymmetry, without broadening forward normalization.

## WRITER-008: Backward absolute search special-cases a lower bound at string end

Pinned `i18npool/source/search/textsearch.cxx`, `NSrchBkwrd`, assigns
`nEnd = sSearchKey.getLength()` when `endPos == searchStr.getLength()`, instead
of adding the key length to the lower bound as in the other branch.

Source-derived initialized example: source `abc`, key `b`, startPos=3 and
endPos=3 returns raw offsets [2,1], although the input interval appears empty.
The transliterated path prepares an empty string first and does not produce
this match. Normal callers may exclude this endpoint combination; that
consumer invariant and compiled native behavior remain unverified. Portable
exhaustive interval checks retain the literal source condition. Decision:
keep the backend condition; Writer range traversal must not call a text search
for an empty interval.

## WRITER-009: Search restores filtered soft-hyphen boundaries differently by direction

Pinned `sw/source/core/crsr/findtxt.cxx`, `DoSearch`, temporarily swaps the
wrapper-normalized match endpoints during backward filtered-position recovery.
The first boundary counts removed positions using `<=`; the second uses `<`.
After swapping back and exchanging point/mark, a soft hyphen exactly on a match
boundary can be included backward and excluded forward.

Source-derived examples: searching `ab` in `U+00AD ab` (without the separating
space in the actual input) yields forward point/mark [3,1], backward [0,3].
Searching `ab` in `ab U+00AD` (again with no space) yields forward [2,0], backward
[0,3]. An internal soft hyphen belongs to both matches. A one-character
U+00AD pattern disables stripping, while a multi-character literal pattern
containing U+00AD does not. These source predicates and cursor endpoints are
preserved in `sw/source/core/crsr/findtxt.test.ts`. Tests are portable source
contract checks; compiled upstream execution and complete consumer invariants
are unverified. Decision: retain the exact directional predicates and the
single-character-only literal exception.

## Recording future observations

Add a stable `WRITER-###` case ID, pinned source location, original condition,
concrete defined result or a clearly labelled source proof, existing acceptance
evidence, consumer uncertainty and the preservation decision. Update an entry
when stronger evidence arrives. An unusual source expression is sufficient for
an observation, not sufficient for a confirmed defect classification or an
implementation change.
