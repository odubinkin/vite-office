# Calc coordinate foundation

Calc implementation lives in `apps/office/src/sc`, independently of Writer.
The first core task is `202610090711-S6VCEJ`, on branch `calc`; branch integration
belongs to the user. Its baseline is LibreOffice commit
`9bc445578031fecf56086729d8e4940c77e14d65`. The ignored
`vendor/libreoffice-reference` symlink reads the existing reference in
`vite-office`; it does not change that checkout.

`sc/inc/types.ts` retains native coordinate type names. `sc/inc/address.ts`
owns sheet limits, sentinels, validity helpers and reference flags. The numerical
`ScAddress` and `ScRange` owners live in `sc/source/core/tool/address.ts` and are
exported through the header boundary. There are no browser models or Writer
dependencies in these owners.

The standard bounds are 1,048,576 rows, 16,384 columns and 10,000 sheets. Address
assignment narrows rows to signed 32 bits and columns/sheets to signed 16 bits.
The default address/range is zero; the invalid constructor sets every coordinate
to -1. `IsValid()` checks nonnegative coordinates only; `ValidAddress()` and
`ValidRange()` apply document row/column bounds and the global sheet bound.

Address-pair range construction independently orders all three axes. Numeric
six-coordinate construction and range copies preserve the supplied order.
Endpoints are independent value owners; assignment retains their identity.
Containment and intersection include both endpoints. Address ordering is
sheet, column, row; row-major import/export ordering is sheet, row, column.

`Move()` retains the original inclusive `GetTableCount()` boundary. It clamps
the actual address and returns false when movement exceeds any bound. Error
outputs retain the requested narrowed coordinates; an overflowing sheet error
is always `MAXTAB + 1`. Range movement processes both endpoints after a failure
and suppresses movement along an axis spanning the entire sheet.

JavaScript tuples represent native output reference parameters. Equality and
ordering methods represent C++ operators. Undefined native uninitialized
constructors, pointer layout, `size_t` hashing and native debug assertions are
not represented. Reference parsing/formatting, external links, subtraction and
sticky update operations remain subsequent tasks. The registry records the
implemented foundation with semantic parity unverified; 100% local coverage
does not establish whole Calc or whole upstream API parity.

Common `svl`, `editeng`, `sfx2`, `framework`, `package`, `sax`, `xmloff`, `svx`
and `vcl` owners will be reused for Calc as needed. Shared changes require tests
of the affected shared module and its Writer/Calc consumers. Calc-specific
document, table, column, cell and formula ownership stays in `sc`. Shared
notification, undo, item pooling, document shell and ODF package mechanisms
must not be copied into the Calc tree.

The intentional browser I/O and recovery decisions in
[document-lifecycle.md](document-lifecycle.md) and
[autosave-recovery.md](autosave-recovery.md) also apply to Calc. ODS-specific
filters and storage adapters will use these shared shell contracts; no recovery
workflow is introduced.

Run `npm run test:coverage:calc`, `npm run typecheck`,
`npm run check:dependencies` and `npm run inventory:parity:calc` for the foundation.
All four real V8 coverage metrics must be 100%. Full-suite scheduling starts
with Calc task 1 of 10 here; run the full suite after task 10, then repeat each
ten completed Calc agentplane tasks. Targeted affected-module tests run on
intervening tasks. Writer acceptance files and coverage settings remain intact.

Source research includes the per-file MPL 2.0 and inherited Apache notices in
`sc/inc/address.hxx` and `sc/source/core/tool/address.cxx`, and MPL 2.0 in
`sc/inc/types.hxx`. The TypeScript implementation is independently authored
from those numerical contracts; the original sources remain research-only.
